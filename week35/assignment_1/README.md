# Assignment 1: Environment Setup & Intro to Python

Run the program `assignment_1.py` from **within your virtual machine**.  _NB: Do not run the Python file in a local Python installation, nor in a notebook on Azure._

### Tasks:
  1. List the all files that this program generates.
  2. Describe which types of files this program generates and attach the contents of each file together with its name to your solution.
  3. What is the output of this program?
  4. Describe in natural language -- line-by-line of code -- what the Python script is doing.
  5. Write (code) a function in the assignment_1.py file, which plots a histogram of the price data, with -- say -- 7 bins in the hisotgram.
  6. Write (text) a sentence into the assignment_1.py about the result of the histogram.


## Hand-in Procedure
  * Create a Markdown (.md) file called `README.md` with your solutions to tasks 1. -- 6. above, in your group's Github repository.
    * **OBS** You create a markdown document. No MS Word file, no PDF, no other format. Use `.md` only.
  * Your group will work with that group GitHub repository during the entire course.
  * Hand-in at latest on Wednesday, Sept. 4th at 11:59. You will upload a link to the markdown document on PeerGrade -- one link per group.

## Hints:
  * The easiest way to get up-and-running is by cloning this repository (`soft2019fall-bi-teaching-material`) to your computer. Then, create the virtual machine (VM) if you have not done so -- see directory `soft2019fall-bi-teaching-material/vm`. Log onto the VM, and then change the present working directory to this Assignment 1.
  * To run the program sucessfully you need to be connected to the internet.
  * You can run the program either from the command-line `$ python assignment_1.py` or from within a notebook or the REPL by importing `assignment_1.py` via something like:

"
  `import assignment_1` ; `assignment_1.run()`
"

  _NB: To do the latter the file `assignment_1.py` has to be located in the same directory as the notebook you are working on._
